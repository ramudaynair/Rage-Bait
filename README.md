# [RageBait] üéØ

## Basic Details
### Team Name: [Ryze]

### Project Description
A chaotic VS Code extension that listens to your voice for trigger words and even catches them when you type, then randomly either **destroys** or **fixes** your code.  
Because who needs predictability?


---

### The Problem (that definitely exists)
Programmers get frustrated ‚Äî code breaks, bugs pile up, and sanity slips.  
There‚Äôs no dramatic flair to those moments (just tears).

---

### The Solution (nobody asked for it)
RageBait turns your frustration into unpredictable action.  
Say ‚Äúugh‚Äù or ‚Äúshey‚Äù? The code either gets AI rescued or obliterated, but always with style.

---

## Technical Details

### Technologies Used
- **Software**: JavaScript, VS Code Extension API, Node.js, GitHub Copilot API, Google Gemini API
- **Tools**: vsce, npm, Web Speech API (via local speech server)
